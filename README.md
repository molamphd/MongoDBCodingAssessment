To run the program in Windows from the Command Line: 

-> Navigate to the location where flatten.py is saved on your machine.
-> Enter: python flatten.py


I don't have access to a Linux machine currently but I believe to run the program on Linux you should:

-> Navigate to the location where flatten.py is saved on your machine.
-> Enter: python3 flatten.py or, alternatively, python flatten.py


Points to note: 
* The program was created using Python 3.9.2 and I used PyCharm as my development environment.
* I used the ast import to parse JSON from string to object 
* The JSON Object should be entered on a single line via stdin once the program is running.
* I created a separate file called test.py and ran tests using the unittest import in Python.
